===============

The **python-delsigma** project aims to provide a 1:1 Python replacement of Richard 
Schreier's MATLAB [delta sigma toolbox](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/19-delta-sigma-toolbox).

This project is at a very early stage. Take a look to files.ods for the current status. 

Pull requests welcome!
